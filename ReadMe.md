In this repository I will be going over the use cases of ansible and use it to
launch a local application, using an ansible playbook.

### What is ansible?

Ansible is a configuration management tool that allows us to code and setup servers from one script.

- IT Automation - Automate IT professionals work
- Configuration management

### Ansible - Pull Configuration tool

Pull configuration: Nodes check with the server periodically and fecth the configurations from it.

(ANSIBLE) Push Configuration: Server pushes configuration to the nodes

Playbooks are the instructions to configure the nodes. And are the main tool for configuration management in ansible. 

They are written in YAML.
